    <h2> Sayali Amritkar </h2>
    <p> I am a passionate Engineer with a degree in Electronics & Telecommunication.
      My very first experience with code was at the time when I started my own blog.
      My struggle to customize the blog pages introduced me to HTML & CSS.
      Sooner, the excitement of having the power to structure pages on my own sounded amazing
      and that's when I decided to pursue Web development.

      Recently I have taken up a Full Stack Development program with FACE.
      I am learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Java, C++ and Data Structures.
      Rational thought process and goal-oriented planning are my strengths.
      <span class="break"> </span>
      I am currently on the look out for a challenging role to build
      products that make a difference.
